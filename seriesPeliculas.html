	<h1>Tv series and movies</h1>
	<p>
        As for movies, the ones that interest me the most are those of the fiction genre, <br> 
        this since I like how it is that you can create a world from scratch which is not <br> 
        similar to reality and can be whatever you want. My favorite movie could be between <br> 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/">'Speed Racer'</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113198/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">'A Goofy movie'</a>. 
        The reason I choose these movies is because I <br> 
        like the plots and the messages they can leave.

        As for series, the truth is that I am not a person who likes to watch television <br> 
        series very much but if I had to choose, they would have to be animated series since <br> 
        it is something that interests me. <br> 
        My favorite tv series would be <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">'Avatar: The Last Airbender'</a>
        and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458290/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1"> 'Star Wars: The clone wars'</a>.
